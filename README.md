# Anime and Character Management System

## Intro to the Project
This project is a web-based application built with Laravel for managing anime shows and their characters. It provides a comprehensive solution for adding, editing, and deleting animes and characters. The application is designed to be user-friendly, with distinct interfaces for public and admin users.

## Features and Database Schema

### CRUD Modules
The application includes two main CRUD modules:

#### 1. Anime Management
- **Create:** Admins can add new anime entries with details such as Title, Description, Episodes, Image URL, Status, Genre, and Release Date.
- **Read:** Users can view a list of all animes and detailed information about each anime.
- **Update:** Admins can edit existing anime details.
- **Delete:** Admins can delete an anime entry.

#### 2. Character Management
- **Create:** Admins can add new characters with details such as Name, Bio, Image URL, Gender, Age, and Anime ID (foreign key).
- **Read:** Users can view a list of characters and detailed information about each character.
- **Update:** Admins can edit existing character details.
- **Delete:** Admins can delete a character entry.

### Relationships
- **One-to-Many Relationship:** Each anime can have multiple characters. The `anime_id` foreign key in the `characters` table establishes this relationship.

### Authentication
- **Admin Users:** Have full access to CRUD operations for both animes and characters. They can manage content through the admin dashboard.
- **Public Users:** Can view animes and characters but cannot perform any other operations.

### Database Schema
- **Animes Table:** Contains columns for `id`, `title`, `description`, `episodes`, `image_url`, `status`, `genre`, and `release_date`.
- **Characters Table:** Contains columns for `id`, `name`, `bio`, `image_url`, `gender`, `age`, and `anime_id` (foreign key).

## Implementation Details

### CRUD Modules
- Admin routes are protected using middleware to restrict access to authorized users.

### Authentication
- Admin users are seeded in the database to test CRUD functionalities.
- Middleware is used to differentiate between admin and public user roles.

### Dashboard and Views
- Created a dedicated admin dashboard for managing content.
- Designed public views for listing and viewing detailed information about animes and characters.
- The admin interface includes forms for creating and editing records.

## Reflection on Laravel and this Course
Developing with Laravel proved to be a significant improvement over working with vanilla PHP. The frameworkâ€™s features streamlined development and allowed me to focus more on functionality, reminiscent of my experience with JavaScript frameworks, which I prefer and am more familiar with.

The course covered the essential aspects of Laravel effectively. For further exploration, integrating Laravel with modern front-end frameworks like Vue.js could provide a more comprehensive full-stack development experience.
