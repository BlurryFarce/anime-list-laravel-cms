# Anime and Character Management System

## Intro to the Project
This project is a web-based application built with Laravel for managing anime shows and their characters. It provides functionality for adding, editing, and deleting animes and characters, with a user-friendly interface for both public and admin users.

## Features and Database Schema
The application includes:
- **CRUD Modules** for Anime and Characters:
  - **Anime**: Title, Description, Episodes, Image URL, Status, Genre, Release Date.
  - **Character**: Name, Bio, Image URL, Gender, Age, Anime ID (foreign key).
- **Relationship**: Each anime can have multiple characters, forming a one-to-many relationship.
- **Authentication**: Admin users can manage all CRUD operations, while regular users can view public information.

**Database Schema:**
- **Animes** Table: `id`, `title`, `description`, `episodes`, `image_url`, `status`, `genre`, `release_date`
- **Characters** Table: `id`, `name`, `bio`, `image_url`, `gender`, `age`, `anime_id` (foreign key)

##Reflection on Laravel and this Course
Developing with Laravel proved to be a significant improvement over working with vanilla PHP. The frameworkâ€™s features streamlined development and allowed me to focus more on functionality, reminiscent of my experience with JavaScript frameworks, which I prefer and am more familiar with.

The course covered the essential aspects of Laravel effectively. For further exploration, integrating Laravel with modern front-end frameworks like Vue.js could provide a more comprehensive full-stack development experience.
